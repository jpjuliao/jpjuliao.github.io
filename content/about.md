As a certified Software Developer with over 10 years of experience, I thrive in diverse environments, leveraging my mastery of frameworks, libraries, and CMSs to build high-quality web applications. I utilize established design patterns and best practices to ensure code cleanness, maintainability, and scalability, while specializing in crafting functional, responsive, and blazing-fast user interfaces through client-side and server-side rendering techniques. 

Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong soft skills like communication, problem-solving, leadership, and time management, enabling me to collaborate effectively, tackle complex challenges, guide teams, and deliver projects on time. Leveraging Agile methodologies, CI/CD processes, and automated workflows, I've collaborated with global brands like Toyota, UCLA Health, and Banco Santander to deliver top-notch solutions.
